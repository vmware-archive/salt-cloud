.SH VM PROFILES
.sp
Salt cloud designates virtual machines inside the profile configuration file.
The profile configuration file defaults to \fB/etc/salt/cloud.profiles\fP and is
a yaml configuration. The syntax for declaring profiles is simple:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
fedora_rackspace:
    provider: rackspace
    image: Fedora 17
    size: 256 server
    script: Fedora
.ft P
.fi
.sp
A few key peices of information need to be declared and can change based on the
public cloud provider. A number of additional parameters can also be inserted:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
centos_rackspace:
    provider: rackspace
    image: CentOS 6.2
    size: 1024 server
    script: RHEL6
    minion:
        master: salt.example.com
    grains:
        role: webserver
.ft P
.fi
.sp
The image must be selected from available images. Similarly, sizes must be
selected from the list of sizes. To get a list of available images and sizes
use the following command:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt\-cloud \-\-list\-images openstack
salt\-cloud \-\-list\-sizes openstack
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Some parameters can be specified in the main Salt cloud config file and then
are applied to all cloud profiles. For instance if only a single cloud provider
is being used then the provider option can be declared in the Salt cloud config
file.

.SH CLOUD MAP FILE
.sp
A number of options exist when creating virtual machines. They can be managed
directly from profiles and the command line execution, or a more complex map
file can be created. The map file allows for a number of virtual machines to
be created and associated with specific profiles.
.sp
Map files have a simple format, specify a profile and then a list of virtual
machines to make from said profile:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
fedora_small:
    \- web1
    \- web2
    \- web3
fedora_high:
    \- redis1
    \- redis2
    \- redis3
cent_high:
    \- riak1
    \- riak2
    \- riak3
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This map file can then be called to roll out all of these virtual machines. Map
files are called from the salt\-cloud command with the \-m option:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ salt\-cloud \-m /path/to/mapfile
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Remember, that as with direct profile provisioning the \-P option can be passed
to create the virtual machines in parallel:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ salt\-cloud \-m /path/to/mapfile \-P
.ft P
.fi
.sp
A map file can also be enforced to represent the total state of a cloud
deployment by using the \fB\-\-hard\fP option. When using the hard option any vms
that exist but are not specified in the map file will be destroyed:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ salt\-cloud \-m /path/to/mapfile \-P \-H
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Be careful with this argument, it is very dangerous! In fact, it is so
dangerous that in order to use it, you must explicitly enable it in the main
configuration file.
.sp
.nf
.ft C
enable_hard_maps: True
.ft P
.fi
.sp
A map file can include grains:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
fedora_small:
    \- web1:
        minion:
            log_level: debug
        grains:
            cheese: tasty
            omelet: du fromage
    \- web2:
        minion:
            log_level: warn
        grains:
            cheese: more tasty
            omelet: with peppers
.ft P
.fi
.sp
A map file may also be used with the various query options:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ salt\-cloud \-m /path/to/mapfile \-Q
{\(aqaws\(aq: {\(aqweb1\(aq: {\(aqid\(aq: \(aqi\-e6aqfegb\(aq,
                     \(aqimage\(aq: None,
                     \(aqprivate_ips\(aq: [],
                     \(aqpublic_ips\(aq: [],
                     \(aqsize\(aq: None,
                     \(aqstate\(aq: 0}},
         \(aqweb2\(aq: {\(aqAbsent\(aq}}
.ft P
.fi
.sp
...or with the delete option:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ salt\-cloud \-m /path/to/mapfile \-d
The following virtual machines are set to be destroyed:
  web1
  web2

Proceed? [N/y]

.SH WRITING CLOUD PROVIDER MODULES
.sp
Salt Cloud runs on a module system similar to the main Salt project. The
modules inside saltcloud exist in the \fBsaltcloud/clouds\fP directory of the
salt\-cloud source.
.sp
Adding a provider requires that a cloud module is created. The cloud module
needs to only impliment a single function \fBcreate\fP, which will accept a
single virtual machine data structure. Whatever functions need to be called to
execute the create function can and should be included in the provider module.
.sp
A good example to follow for writing a cloud provider module is the module
provided for Linode:
.sp
\fI\%https://github.com/saltstack/salt-cloud/blob/master/saltcloud/clouds/linode.py\fP
.sp
If possible it is prefered that libcloud is used to connect to public cloud
systems, but if libcloud support is not available or another system makes more
sense then by all means, use the other system to connect to the cloud provider.
.sp
An example of a non\-libcloud provider is the ec2 module:
.sp
\fI\%https://github.com/saltstack/salt-cloud/blob/develop/saltcloud/clouds/ec2.py\fP
.SH OS SUPPORT FOR CLOUD VMS
.sp
Salt Cloud works primarily by executing a script on the virtual machines as
soon as they become available. The script that is executed is referenced in the
cloud profile as the \fBscript\fP. In older versions, this was the \fBos\fP
argument. This was changed in 0.8.2.
.sp
A number of legacy scripts exist in the deploy directory in the saltcloud
source tree. The preferred method is currently to use the salt\-bootstrap
script. A stable version is included with each release tarball starting with
0.8.4. The most updated version can be found at:
.sp
\fI\%https://github.com/saltstack/salt-bootstrap\fP
.sp
If you do not specify a script argument, this script will be used at the
default.
.sp
If the Salt Bootstrap script does not meet your needs, you may write your own.
The script should be written in bash and is a Jinja template. Deploy scripts
need to execute a number of functions to do a complete salt setup. These
functions include:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
Install the salt minion. If this can be done via system packages this method
is HIGHLY preferred.
.IP 2. 3
Add the salt minion keys before the minion is started for the first time.
The minion keys are available as strings that can be copied into place in
the Jinja template under the dict named "vm".
.IP 3. 3
Start the salt\-minion daemon and enable it at startup time.
.IP 4. 3
Set up the minion configuration file from the "minion" data available in
the Jinja template.
.UNINDENT
.sp
A good, well commented, example of this process is the Fedora deployment
script:
.sp
\fI\%https://github.com/saltstack/salt-cloud/blob/master/saltcloud/deploy/Fedora.sh\fP
.sp
A number of legacy deploy scripts are included with the release tarball. None
of them are as functional or complete as Salt Bootstrap, and are still included
for academic purposes.
.SS Other Generic Deploy Scripts
.sp
If you want to be assured of always using the latest Salt Bootstrap script,
there are a few generic templates available in the deploy directory of your
saltcloud source tree:
.sp
These are example scripts which were designed to be customized, adapted, and
refit to meet your needs. One important use of them is to pass options to
the salt\-bootstrap script, such as updating to specific git tags.
.SS Post\-Deploy Commands
.sp
Once a minion has been deployed, it has the option to run a salt command.
Normally, this would be the state.highstate command, which would finish
provisioning the VM. Another common option is state.sls, or for just testing,
test.ping. This is configured in the main cloud config file:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
start_action: state.highstate
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This is currently considered to be experimental functionality, and may not work
well with all providers. If you experience problems with Salt Cloud hanging
after Salt is deployed, consider using Startup States instead:
.sp
\fI\%http://docs.saltstack.org/en/latest/ref/states/startup.html\fP
.SS Skipping the Deploy Script
.sp
For whatever reason, you may want to skip the deploy script altogether. This
results in a VM being spun up much faster, with absolutely no configuration.
This can be set from the command line:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt\-cloud \-\-no\-deploy \-p micro_aws my_instance
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Or it can be set from the main cloud config file:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
deploy: False
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Or it can be set from the provider\(aqs configuration:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
RACKSPACE.user: example_user
RACKSPACE.apikey: 123984bjjas87034
RACKSPACE.deploy: False
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Or even on the VM\(aqs profile settings:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
ubuntu_aws:
  provider: aws
  image: ami\-7e2da54e
  size: Micro Instance
  deploy: False
.ft P
.fi
.sp
The default for deploy is True.
.sp
In the profile, you may also set the script option to \fBNone\fP:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
script: None
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This is the slowest option, since it still uploads the None deploy script and
executes it.
.SS Updating Salt Bootstrap
.sp
Salt Bootstrap can be updated automatically with salt\-cloud:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt\-cloud \-u
salt\-cloud \-\-update\-bootstrap
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Bear in mind that this updates to the latest (unstable) version, so use with
caution.
.SS Keeping /tmp/ Files
.sp
When Salt Cloud deploys an instance, it uploads temporary files to /tmp/ for
salt\-bootstrap to put in place. After the script has run, they are deleted. To
keep these files around (mostly for debugging purposes), the \-\-keep\-tmp option
can be added:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt\-cloud \-p myprofile mymachine \-\-keep\-tmp
.ft P
.fi
.sp
For those wondering why /tmp/ was used instead of /root/, this had to be done
for images which require the use of sudo, and therefore do not allow remote
root logins, even for file transfers (which makes /root/ unavailable).
.SS Deploy Script Arguments
.sp
Custom deploy scripts are unlikely to need custom arguments to be passed to
them, but salt\-bootstrap has been extended quite a bit, and this may be
necessary. script_args can be specified in either the profile or the map file,
to pass arguments to the deploy script:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
aws\-amazon:
    provider: aws
    image: ami\-1624987f
    size: Micro Instance
    ssh_username: ec2\-user
    script: bootstrap\-salt
    script_args: \-c /tmp/
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This has also been tested to work with pipes, if needed:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
script_args: | head
.ft P
.fi
.SH CORE CONFIGURATION
.sp
A number of core configuration options and some options that are global to the
VM profiles can be set in the cloud config file. By default this file is
located at \fB/etc/salt/cloud\fP.
.SS Minion Configuration
.sp
The default minion configuration is set up in this file. This is where the
minions that are created derive their configuration.
.sp
.nf
.ft C
minion:
    master: saltmaster.example.com
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This is the location in particular to specify the location of the salt master.
.SS Cloud Configurations
.sp
The data specific to interacting with public clouds is set up here.
.SS Rackspace
.sp
Rackspace cloud requires two configuration options:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
RACKSPACE.user: example_user
RACKSPACE.apikey: 123984bjjas87034
.ft P
.fi
.SS Amazon AWS
.sp
A number of configuration options are required for Amazon AWS:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
AWS.id: HJGRYCILJLKJYG
AWS.key: \(aqkdjgfsgm;woormgl/aserigjksjdhasdfgn\(aq
AWS.keyname: test
AWS.securitygroup: quick\-start
AWS.private_key: /root/test.pem
.ft P
.fi
.SS Linode
.sp
Linode requires a single api key, but the default root password also needs
to be set:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
LINODE.apikey: asldkgfakl;sdfjsjaslfjaklsdjf;askldjfaaklsjdfhasldsadfghdkf
LINODE.password: F00barbaz
.ft P
.fi
.sp
The password needs to be 8 characters and contain lowercase, uppercase and
numbers.
.SS Joyent Cloud
.sp
The Joyent cloud requires three configuration paramaters. The user name and
password that are used to log into the Joyent system, and the location of
the private ssh key associated with the Joyent account. The ssh key is needed
to send the provisioning commands up to the freshly created virtual machine,
.sp
.nf
.ft C
JOYENT.user: fred
JOYENT.password: saltybacon
JOYENT.private_key: /root/joyent.pem
.ft P
.fi
.SS GoGrid
.sp
To use Salt Cloud with GoGrid log into the GoGrid web interface and
create an api key. Do this by clicking on "My Account" and then going to the
API Keys tab.
.sp
The GOGRID.apikey and the GOGRID.sharedsecret configuration paramaters need to
be set in the config file to enable interfacing with GoGrid:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
GOGRID.apikey: asdff7896asdh789
GOGRID.sharedsecret: saltybacon
.ft P
.fi
.SS OpenStack
.sp
OpenStack configuration differs between providers, and at the moment several
options need to be specified. This module has been officially tested against
the HP and the Rackspace implementations, and some examples are provided for
both.
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# For HP
OPENSTACK.identity_url: \(aqhttps://region\-a.geo\-1.identity.hpcloudsvc.com:35357/v2.0/\(aq
OPENSTACK.compute_name: Compute
OPENSTACK.compute_region: \(aqaz\-1.region\-a.geo\-1\(aq
OPENSTACK.tenant: myuser\-tenant1
OPENSTACK.user: myuser
OPENSTACK.ssh_key_name: mykey
OPENSTACK.ssh_key_file: \(aq/etc/salt/hpcloud/mykey.pem\(aq
OPENSTACK.password: mypass

# For Rackspace
OPENSTACK.identity_url: \(aqhttps://identity.api.rackspacecloud.com/v2.0/tokens\(aq
OPENSTACK.compute_name: cloudServersOpenStack
OPENSTACK.protocol: ipv4
OPENSTACK.compute_region: DFW
OPENSTACK.protocol: ipv4
OPENSTACK.user: myuser
OPENSTACK.tenant: 5555555
OPENSTACK.password: mypass
.ft P
.fi
.sp
If you have an API key for your provider, it may be specified instead of a
password:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
OPENSTACK.apikey: 901d3f579h23c8v73q9
.ft P
.fi
.sp
You will certainly need to configure the \fBuser\fP, \fBtenant\fP and either
\fBpassword\fP or \fBapikey\fP.
.SS IBM SmartCloud Enterprise
.sp
In addition to a username and password, the IBM SCE module requires an SSH key,
which is currently configured inside IBM\(aqs web interface. A location is also
required to create instances, but not to query their cloud. This is important,
because you need to use salt\-cloud \-\-list\-locations (with the other options
already set) in order to find the name of the location that you want to use.
.sp
.nf
.ft C
IBMSCE.user: myuser@mycorp.com
IBMSCE.password: mypass
IBMSCE.ssh_key_name: mykey
IBMSCE.ssh_key_file: \(aq/etc/salt/ibm/mykey.pem\(aq
IBMSCE.location: Raleigh
.ft P
.fi
.SH CLOUD ACTIONS
.sp
Once a VM has been created, there are a number of actions that can be performed
on it. The "reboot" action can be used across all providers, but all other
actions are specific to the cloud provider. In order to perform an action, you
may specify it from the command line, including the name(s) of the VM to
perform the action on:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ salt\-cloud \-a reboot vm_name
$ salt\-cloud \-a reboot vm1 vm2 vm2
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Or you may specify a map which includes all VMs to perform the action on:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ salt\-cloud \-a reboot \-m /path/to/mapfile
.ft P
.fi
.sp
The following is a list of actions currently supported by salt\-cloud:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
all providers:
    \- reboot
aws:
    \- start
    \- stop
joyent:
    \- stop
.ft P
.fi
.SH CLOUD FUNCTIONS
.sp
Cloud functions work much the same way as cloud actions, except that they don\(aqt
perform an operation on a specific instance, and so do not need a machine name
to be specified. However, since they perform an operation on a specific cloud
provider, that provider must be specified.
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ salt\-cloud \-f show_image ec2 image=ami\-fd20ad94
.ft P
.fi
.SH MISCELLANEOUS SALT CLOUD OPTIONS
.sp
This page describes various miscellaneous options available in Salt Cloud
.SS Deploy Script Arguments
.sp
Custom deploy scripts are unlikely to need custom arguments to be passed to
them, but salt\-bootstrap has been extended quite a bit, and this may be
necessary. script_args can be specified in either the profile or the map file,
to pass arguments to the deploy script:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
aws\-amazon:
    provider: aws
    image: ami\-1624987f
    size: Micro Instance
    ssh_username: ec2\-user
    script: bootstrap\-salt
    script_args: \-c /tmp/
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This has also been tested to work with pipes, if needed:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
script_args: | head
.ft P
.fi
.SS Sync After Install
.sp
Salt allows users to create custom modules, grains and states which can be
synchronised to minions to extend Salt with further functionality.
.sp
This option will inform Salt Cloud to synchronise your custom modules, grains,
states or all these to the minion just after it has been created. For this to
happen, the following line needs to be added to the main cloud
configuration file:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
sync_after_install: all
.ft P
.fi
.sp
The available options for this setting are:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
modules
grains
states
all
.ft P
.fi
.SS Setting up New Salt Masters
.sp
It has become increasingly common for users to set up multi\-hierarchal
infrastructures using Salt Cloud. This sometimes involves setting up an
instance to be a master in addition to a minion. With that in mind, you can
now law down master configuration on a machine by specifying master options
in the profile or map file.
.sp
.nf
.ft C
make_master: True
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This will cause Salt Cloud to generate master keys for the instance, and tell
salt\-bootstrap to install the salt\-master package, in addition to the
salt\-minion package.
.sp
The default master configuration is usually appropriate for most users, and
will not be changed unless specific master configuration has been added to the
profile or map:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
master:
    user: root
    interface: 0.0.0.0
.ft P
.fi
.SS Delete SSH Keys
.sp
When Salt Cloud deploys an instance, the SSH pub key for the instance is added
to the known_hosts file for the user that ran the salt\-cloud command. When an
instance is deployed, a cloud provider generally recycles the IP address for
the instance.  When Salt Cloud attempts to deploy an instance using a recycled
IP address that has previously been accessed from the same machine, the old key
in the known_hosts file will cause a conflict.
.sp
In order to mitigate this issue, Salt Cloud can be configured to remove old
keys from the known_hosts file when destroying the node. In order to do this,
the following line needs to be added to the main cloud configuration file:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
delete_sshkeys: True
.ft P
.fi
.SS Keeping /tmp/ Files
.sp
When Salt Cloud deploys an instance, it uploads temporary files to /tmp/ for
salt\-bootstrap to put in place. After the script has run, they are deleted. To
keep these files around (mostly for debugging purposes), the \-\-keep\-tmp option
can be added:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt\-cloud \-p myprofile mymachine \-\-keep\-tmp
.ft P
.fi
.sp
For those wondering why /tmp/ was used instead of /root/, this had to be done
for images which require the use of sudo, and therefore do not allow remote
root logins, even for file transfers (which makes /root/ unavailable).
.SS Hide Output From Minion Install
.sp
By default Salt Cloud will stream the output from the minion deploy script
directly to STDOUT. Although this can been very useful, in certain cases you
may wish to switch this off. The following config option is there to enable or
disable this output:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
display_ssh_output: False
.ft P
.fi
.SH RELEASE NOTES AND UPGRADE INSTRUCTIONS
.SS Salt Cloud 0.6.0 Release Notes
.sp
The new Salt project, Salt Cloud, is introduced with version 0.6.0. Salt Cloud
has been developed to ease the automation and integration of Salt with public
cloud providers by allowing cloud vms to be cleanly defined, created and
automatically hooked back into a Salt Master.
.sp
While Salt Cloud is primarily made to build cloud vms to tie into a Salt Mater,
it has been created in a generic way, so that it can be used to provision and
hook systems of any type via the familiar Salt modules system.
.sp
This release supports three public cloud providers (all via libcloud),
Amazon EC2, Rackspace Cloud and Linode.
.SS Documentation
.sp
The documentation for Salt Cloud can be found on Read the Docs:
\fI\%http://salt-cloud.readthedocs.org\fP
.SS Download
.sp
Salt Cloud can be downloaded and install via pypi or github:
.sp
\fI\%http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/s/salt-cloud/salt-cloud-0.6.0.tar.gz\fP
.sp
\fI\%https://github.com/downloads/saltstack/salt-cloud/salt-cloud-0.6.0.tar.gz\fP
.sp
Packages are not yet available, Salt Cloud requires three dependencies, the
salt libs, libcloud, and paramiko.
.SS Extensible With Cloud Modules
.sp
The Salt loader system has been employed to make adding support for additional
public cloud systems just as modular and simple as adding support for new
package managers in Salt.
.sp
Adding support for a new cloud provider is extremely simple, just add a cloud
module and everything cleanly links together.
.SS Define VM Profiles
.sp
The way a vms is created is done via profiles. Profiles are used to define what
properties a vm will have, the cloud provider, the size and the image.
.sp
.nf
.ft C
centos_rackspace:
  provider: rackspace
  image: CentOS 6.2
  size: 1024 server
  os: RHEL6
  minion:
    grains:
        role: webserver
    master: salt.example.com
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This profile will be used to create vms on Rackspace cloud with the CentOS 6.2
image and the Rackspace 1024 vm size. Particulars of the minion config can
also be specified.
.sp
Individual vms can be created from profiles:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# salt\-cloud \-p centos_rackspace web1
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This command creates a vms with the name web1 on the Rackspace cloud and
connects the new vm to a Salt Master located at salt.example.com. The new VM
has the Salt id of web1.
.SS Define Maps of Profiles
.sp
When it is desired to have a predefined mapping of many, or a specific group
of vms then a cloud map can be defined:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
centos_rackspace:
  web1
  web2
  web3
  web4
centos_linode:
  redis1
  riak1
  riak2
  riak3
ubuntu_ec2:
  dev1
  dev2
  cassandra1
  cassandra2
  cassandra3
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This map file will create vms named web 1\-4 using the centos_rackspace profile
on rackspace, the redis and riak vms on linode and the dev and Cassandra vms on
ec2. It can be run with salt\-cloud:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# salt\-cloud \-m mapfile
.ft P
.fi
.sp
When creating more than one vm the \-P option can be passed, to make the vms
provision in parallel, greatly speeding up large scale expansions of vms.
.SS Salt Cloud 0.7.0 Release Notes
.sp
Salt Cloud marches forward with the 0.7.0 release. As is customary for Salt
Stack projects the 0.7.0 release is intended to be much more robust and
deliver a more complete core feature set. Salt Cloud 0.7.0 is just that.
.sp
With new tools to help look into what is available on cloud providers,
new additions to make cloud management more stateful and the addition of
more supported cloud platforms 0.7.0 has greatly enhanced the capabilities
of the overall Salt platform.

.SS Destroy!
.sp
Salt Cloud can now destroy cloud vms as easily as it can create them. The new
\fB\-\-destroy\fP option can be passed to end the life of a vm:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ salt\-cloud \-d web1
.ft P
.fi
.sp
The map operation can now also destroy vms, the new \fBhard\fP option can be
passed which makes vm maps much more stateful. With the \fBhard\fP option the
vm maps are viewed as the absolute source of information for the state of
cloud resources, and any vm that is not specified in the map file will be
destroyed:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[root@saltmaster]# salt\-cloud \-m /etc/salt/cloud.map \-H
The following virtual machines are set to be created:

.SS Salt Cloud 0.8.0 Release Notes

release includes many improvements to usability, error handling and general
stability of the product.

.SS Increased Formatting Options
.sp
Additional options have been added to salt\-cloud \-Q, to support the same kinds
of formatting already available in Salt:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\-\-raw\-out
\-\-text\-out
\-\-yaml\-out
\-\-json\-out
\-\-no\-color
.ft P
.fi
.SS More Helpful Error Messages
.sp
As an ongoing effort, we have been cleaning up and adding error messages in an
attempt to make salt\-cloud more helpful when something goes wrong. This
includes displaying messages as they are received from libcloud.
.SS Specify Grains in Map Files
.sp
Previously, map files only had the ability to specify a profile name, and the
node names that would be associated with it. Now you can also specify grains
that will be laid down in each individual node:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
vm_profile:
  \- mynodename:
    minion:
      master: salt\-master
    grains:
      fromage: tasty
.ft P
.fi
.sp
These grains can also be specified in the profile itself. When this happens,
the grains in map files will override grains in the profile. For example:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
vm_profile:
  provider: gogrid
  size: 512MB
  image: CentOS 6.2 (64\-bit) w/ None
  os: RHEL6
  minion:
    master: salt.mycompany.com
  grains:
    french: fries
.ft P
.fi
.sp
In this example, mynodename will include grains for both fromage and french,
but the master will be salt\-master, not salt\-mycompany.com.
.SS AWS Improvements
.sp
AWS is much more complex to work with than any of the other supported cloud
providers. As such, additional configuration has been added in order to
accomodate their usage:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B AWS.ssh_username:
Because AWS images can include a variety of different usernames for the
initial login, this option allows you to specify which one(s) to use to
install salt upon firstboot.
.TP
.B AWS.ssh_interface:
AWS instances include both private and public IP addresses. By default,
salt\-cloud will use the public IP to login. In situations where the
salt\-master is also located within AWS, the private IP can be used instead.
.TP
.B AWS.location and AWS.availability_zone:
These options allow you to specify from within salt\-cloud, which AWS
locations your machines spin up in.
.UNINDENT
.SS Ubuntu Fixes
.sp
Ubuntu packages automatically start the service upon installation, and needed
to be handled differently in the deploy script. Configuration is now laid down
before the package is installed, so that the minion can make its initial start
happen with the correct configuration.
.SS Salt Cloud 0.8.1 Release Notes
.sp
In a somewhat quicker timeline than usual, Salt Cloud 0.8.1 has been released!
While many of the updates in this release focus on stability, users of map
files and AWS also have some new features to look forward to.
.SS Documentation

work of Christer Edwards, and packages for RHEL and Fedora are being created

.SS Full Query Option
.sp
The \-Q or \-\-query option only displays a small amount of information about
each virtual machine. This is to keep command\-line reports small and
manageable. Now the \-F or \-\-full\-query option can be used to display all
of the information about a VM that salt\-cloud knows about. The amount of
information returned varies between providers, depending on the kinds of
functionality available through them.
.SS Increased Map Functionality
.sp
Previously, map files were only used for creating VMs. Now they can also be
used to query and delete VMs. The \-Q, \-F and \-d options can all be used in
conjunction with \-m, to display map\-specific data. If a VM that is specified
in the map does not exist, it will still show up under \-Q and \-F as "Absent".
If a VM specified in the map does not exist when a \-d is specified, it will
of course be ignored.
.SS Multiple Security Groups in AWS
.sp
AWS allows for multiple security groups to be applied to any given VM, but
until this release, Salt Cloud only supported managing one. This update allows
a list of security groups to be specified. In the main configuration file, an
example of multiple security groups would look like:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
AWS.securitygroup:
  \- default
  \- extra
.ft P
.fi
.sp
In a profile, an example would be:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
micro_amazon:
  provider: aws
  image: ami\-e565ba8c
  size: Micro Instance
  os: RHEL6
  securitygroup:
      \- default
      \- extra
.ft P
.fi
.SS Bug Fixes
.sp
A number of bugs have been fixed in this release. Most of these were internal
fixes related to authentication and deployment across various providers. Bug
fixes in this release include:
.sp
Ubuntu users may notice that deploying an instance has become significantly
noisier. A change was made to make Ubuntu display information returned as
packages are installed, which is more aligned with how yum\-based machines
already behaved. This also forced these VMs to deploy salt in a much more
reliable manner.
.sp
Requirements listed in requirements.txt are also pulled into setup.py, to make
it easy to use the easy_install tool.
.sp
Most cloud providers default to root as the initial user, but AWS typically
providers a different user (ec2\-user, ubuntu, bitnami, etc). Deployment on
such images must be handled using sudo. Previously, sudo was used to issue
all deployment commands, but this failed on images where sudo was not installed
by default (such as FreeBSD). Now sudo will only be used with non\-root logins.
.SS Salt Cloud 0.8.2 Release Notes
.sp
This is a great release for Salt Cloud! New cloud providers have been added,
and the deploy functionality has been embiggened! Read on to see the cromulent
new features.

.SS Select Query Option
.sp
The last release of Salt Cloud added the \-F/\-\-full query option, to display
all information available for a particular instance. We now also have the \-S
or \-\-select\-query option, which lets you specify which fields to display. Any
fields not specified will not be displayed, and if you specify a field that
doesn\(aqt exist on a particular provider, it will be ignored for them. Just
add a query.selection option to /etc/salt/cloud like such:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
query.selection:
  \- id
  \- state
  \- public_ips
  \- keyname
  \- TOTALXFER
.ft P
.fi
.SS os vs script
.sp
In a cloud profile, you need to specify which deploy script to use to install
Salt on the newly\-provisioned VM. The option for this has always been \(aqos\(aq,
which has been confusing to some. As of this release, you may now specify
\(aqscript\(aq instead of \(aqos\(aq. If you specify both, the value for \(aqscript\(aq will be
used. See the SmartOS Deploy Script below for an example.
.SS SmartOS Deploy Script
.sp
Of particular interest to Joyent users may be the new SmartOS deploy script.
Salt itself is not fully\-supported on SmartOS just yet, in part because ZeroMQ
is also not yet supported. When this script is used for deployment, it will
automatically install the required libraries and build ZeroMQ, and then use
easy_install to install the latest versions of PyZMQ and Salt. To use this,
just specify SmartOS as the \(aqos\(aq or \(aqscript\(aq option in your cloud.profiles:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
joyent_smartos:
  provider: joyent
  size: Extra Small 512 MB
  image: smartos
  script: SmartOS
.ft P
.fi
.SS OpenStack and IBM Modules
.sp
Support has been added for clouds using OpenStack (OPENSTACK) and for IBM\(aqs
SmartCloud Enterprise (IBMSCE) offering. We know that people have already
started using the OpenStack module, because pull requests have already been
merged from the community. This module has been tested against both the HP
and the Rackspace implementations of OpenStack. This can be a tricky module
to configure, depending on your provider, so some examples are provided here:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# For HP
OPENSTACK.identity_url: \(aqhttps://region\-a.geo\-1.identity.hpcloudsvc.com:35357/v2.0/\(aq
OPENSTACK.compute_name: Compute
OPENSTACK.compute_region: \(aqaz\-1.region\-a.geo\-1\(aq
OPENSTACK.tenant: myuser\-tenant1
OPENSTACK.user: myuser
OPENSTACK.ssh_key_name: mykey
OPENSTACK.ssh_key_file: \(aq/etc/salt/hpcloud/mykey.pem\(aq
OPENSTACK.password: mypass

# For Rackspace
OPENSTACK.identity_url: \(aqhttps://identity.api.rackspacecloud.com/v2.0/tokens\(aq
OPENSTACK.compute_name: cloudServersOpenStack
OPENSTACK.compute_region: DFW
OPENSTACK.tenant: 5555555
OPENSTACK.user: myuser
OPENSTACK.password: mypass
OPENSTACK.protocol: ipv4
.ft P
.fi
.sp
It is important to note that currently, only password\-based authentication is
provided through the Salt Cloud OpenStack module.
.sp
IBM has fewer things that need to be configured, but setting them up can be
tricky as well. An example might look like:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
IBMSCE.user: myuser@mycorp.com
IBMSCE.password: mypass
IBMSCE.ssh_key_name: mykey
IBMSCE.ssh_key_file: \(aq/etc/salt/ibm/mykey.pem\(aq
IBMSCE.location: Raleigh
.ft P
.fi
.sp
The location currently must be configured in order to create an instance, but
not to query the IBM cloud. This is important, because you need to use
salt\-cloud \-\-list\-locations (with the other options already set) in order to
find the name of the location that you want to use.
.SS OpenStack with Salt
.sp
This isn\(aqt specifically another Salt Cloud feature, but it should be noted that
with the release of Salt 0.10.5, OpenStack is not only the first Cloud product,
but in fact the first piece of software explicitly supported by both Salt Cloud
(from a user perspective) and Salt itself (from an admin perspective).
.SS Salt Cloud Logging
.sp
Those who have tried to hack on Salt Cloud may have discovered a complete lack
of logging support. With this release, Salt Cloud has started to implement
the logging features already available in Salt. The default log location is
/var/log/salt/cloud (with a default level of warn), but it can be changed in
your cloud configuration file:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
log_file: /var/log/salt/cloud
log_level_logfile: debug
.ft P
.fi
.sp
If you would like to change the default logging level for the command line, you
can also configure that in the same place:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
log_level: debug
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Check salt\-cloud \-\-help for a list of logging levels, which can also be
specified from the command line.
.SS Salt Cloud 0.8.3 Release Notes
.sp
Welcome to 0.8.3! While there are some new features, this release of Salt
Cloud is primarily targeted at stability. Read on to see what\(aqs happened.
.SS Documentation
.sp
The documentation for Salt Cloud can be found on Read the Docs:
\fI\%http://salt-cloud.readthedocs.org\fP
.SS Download
.sp
Salt Cloud can be downloaded and install via pypi or github:
.sp
\fI\%http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/s/salt-cloud/salt-cloud-0.8.3.tar.gz\fP
.sp
\fI\%https://github.com/downloads/saltstack/salt-cloud/salt-cloud-0.8.3.tar.gz\fP
.sp
Some packages have been made available for salt\-cloud and more on on their
way. Packages for Arch and FreeBSD are being made available thanks to the
work of Christer Edwards, and packages for RHEL and Fedora are being created
by Clint Savage. Package availability will be announced on the salt mailing list.
.SS No Deploy
.sp
Salt Cloud was originally intended to spin up machines and deploy Salt on them,
but several use cases have arisen in which this is not the appropriate action.
For instance, when booting into new platforms which may not even support Salt
just yet, it makes no sense to try and install a non\-existant package. In these
instances, you can add the \-\-no\-deploy argument to the salt\-cloud command to
skip running the deploy script.
.sp
It is also possible to configure Salt Cloud to default to never deploying:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
deploy: False
.ft P
.fi
.SS Firing Events
.sp
Salt Cloud is starting to make use of Salt\(aqs event system. If you are watching
the event bus on the Salt Master, you can now watch for events to fire when
minions are created or destroyed.
.SS Start Actions
.sp
This is an experimental feature which some users may find handy. You may now
configure a start_action for a deployed VM:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
start_action: state.highstate
.ft P
.fi
.sp
If configured, when the salt\-cloud command runs the deploy script, it will open
a subprocess to wait for the salt\-minion service to start, and check in with
the master (via the salt event bus). This feature does not currently work
smoothly with all providers, particularly the ones which do not use "root" as
the default login users. Your mileage will vary.
.SS Exception Handling
.sp
There were a handful of spots in the code which would exit when an error
occurred, sometimes without any meaningful error messages. This was was neither
helpful to the user, nor Pythonic. Errors now should fire an exception of some
sort, and if the error is Salt\- or Salt Cloud\-specific, a SaltException will be
fired. This also helps pave the way for API usage of Salt Cloud.
.SS Provider\-Specific Actions
.sp
This is largely a programmatic addition at this point, which will continue to
expand into userland. All providers supported by libcloud provide a minimum
level of functionality that Salt Cloud takes advantage of. Most providers also
include a number of "extra" functions which are non\-standard. Some of these
are critical in certain instances. For instance, most providers will shut down
a VM for you when you send a destroy command, but Joyent requires you to
manually shut it down first. This was previously only doable via their web
interface. You may now pass a supported \-\-action (or \-a) to a cloud provider:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt\-cloud \-\-action stop joyentvm1
.ft P
.fi
.sp
All cloud providers support the destroy command via an action:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt\-cloud \-a destroy mymachine1 mymachine2 mymachine2
.ft P
.fi
.SS Human\-Readable States
.sp
Most of our cloud providers are accessed via libcloud, which provides a
numerical code declaring the current state of the machine. This state is
viewable via the various query options. Unfortunately, if you don\(aqt know what
the codes mean, they\(aqre largely useless to you. Now, with the \-Q or \-\-query
option, a human\-readable state (i.e. RUNNING) will de displayed instead).
.sp
It should be noted that because some users are running salt\-cloud via another
script, the \-F/\-\-full\-query and \-S/\-\-select\-query options still return the
numerical code.
.SS Various other Features and Stability Fixes
.sp
The above features addressed many stability issues. Additionally, the following
have been addressed.
.sp
Salt Cloud requires at least libcloud 0.11.4. If you are not running at least
this version, an exception will be fired.
.sp
A certain amount of minion configuration is required for all VMs. If you fail
to specify any, a (mostly empty) minion config will be created for you. The
default master for this config will be "salt".
.sp
Previously, Joyent supported all Salt Cloud features without using Salt Cloud\(aqs
own built\-in deploy function. This is no longer the case, and so the Joyent
module has been updated appropriately.
.sp
Some log settings where previously ignored. This has been fixed.
.sp
The Rackspace module previously would silently strip certain characters from
a VM name. It now has a base set of characters that it will verify against, and
raise an exception if an illegal character was specified. This functionality is
also available for other cloud providers, but not currently set up for them.
.sp
AWS introduced a new region in Sydney. This region is not available in the
latest official libcloud release, but if you happen to be running libcloud out
of trunk, it will be supported by Salt Cloud.
.sp
Additional logging and PEP\-8 fixes have also been applied. This should only
affect developers.
.SS Salt Cloud 0.8.4 Release Notes
.sp
Welcome to 0.8.4! Aside from various bug fixes, the most important improvements
in this release are to the deploy scripts. Read on to see what\(aqs happened.
.SS Documentation
.sp
The documentation for Salt Cloud can be found on Read the Docs:
\fI\%http://salt-cloud.readthedocs.org\fP
.SS Download
.sp
Salt Cloud can be downloaded and install via pypi:
.sp
\fI\%http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/s/salt-cloud/salt-cloud-0.8.4.tar.gz\fP
.sp
Some packages have been made available for salt\-cloud and more on on their
way. Packages for Arch and FreeBSD are being made available thanks to the
work of Christer Edwards, and packages for RHEL and Fedora are being created
by Clint Savage. The Ubuntu PPA is being managed by Sean Channel. Package
availability will be announced on the salt mailing list.
.SS Salt Bootstrap
.sp
By far the biggest change to Salt Cloud is the inclusion of the salt\-bootstrap
script, made possible by the genius of Alec Koumjian and Pedro Algarvio. From
this point on, each release of Salt Cloud will include the latest stable
version of bootstrap\-salt\-minion.sh in the deploy folder. This is a generic,
POSIX\-compliant deployment script, which autodetects your OS, and installs
the latest version of Salt accordingly. For more information, see:
.sp
\fI\%https://github.com/saltstack/salt-bootstrap\fP
.sp
To use this deploy script explicitly, set the script option to
bootstrap\-salt\-minion in the profile for your VM. For instance:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
aws\-archlinux:
    provider: aws
    image: ami\-0356da6a
    size: Micro Instance
    script: bootstrap\-salt\-minion
    ssh_username: root
.ft P
.fi
.sp
For those of you still using "os" in your profiles, it should be noted that
this option was renamed to "script" in 0.8.2, and your configuration should
be updated accordingly.
.SS Optional Script Option
.sp
As mentioned above, usage of the "os" argument has been deprecated in favor of
the "script" argument. However, "script" is now optional. If you do not
specify this option, salt\-cloud will default to bootstrap\-salt\-minion for you.
If you do not want any deployment scripts run, you still have the following
options available to you.
.sp
From the command line, use the \-\-no\-deploy option:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt\-cloud \-\-no\-deploy \-p myprofile mymachine
.ft P
.fi
.sp
In the Salt Cloud configuration, set:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
deploy: False
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Or in the profile, set the script option to None:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
script: None
.ft P
.fi
.SS Other Generic Deploy Scripts
.sp
If you want to be assured of always using the latest Salt Bootstrap script,
there are now a few generic templates available in the deploy directory of
your saltcloud source tree:
.sp
These are example scripts which were designed to be customized, adapted, and
refit to meet your needs. One important use of them is to pass options to
the salt\-bootstrap script, such as updating to specific git tags.
.SS Salt Cloud 0.8.5 Release Notes
.sp
Welcome to 0.8.5! Some important things have happened in this release, that
you\(aqll want to take note of. The first thing that may trip you up when
installing directly is that Paramiko is no longer a dependency, and botocore
and sshpass are new dependencies. Read on to see what else has happened.
.SS Documentation
.sp
The documentation for Salt Cloud can be found on Read the Docs:
\fI\%http://salt-cloud.readthedocs.org\fP
.SS Download
.sp
Salt Cloud can be downloaded and install via pypi:
.sp
\fI\%http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/s/salt-cloud/salt-cloud-0.8.5.tar.gz\fP
.sp
Some packages have been made available for salt\-cloud and more on on their
way. Packages for Arch and FreeBSD are being made available thanks to the
work of Christer Edwards, and packages for RHEL and Fedora are being created
by Clint Savage. The Ubuntu PPA is being managed by Sean Channel. Package
availability will be announced on the salt mailing list.
.SS Salt Bootstrap
.sp
In 0.8.4, the default deploy script was set to bootstrap\-salt\-minion. Since
then, the Salt Boostrap script has been extended to be able to install more
than just minions, and as such, has been renamed. It is now called
bootstrap\-salt, and has been renamed in Salt Cloud accordingly. Check out the
salt\-bootstrap project for more details:
.sp
\fI\%https://github.com/saltstack/salt-bootstrap\fP
.sp
Just another reminder: For those of you still using "os" in your profiles, this
option was renamed to "script" in 0.8.2, and your configuration should be
updated accordingly.
.SS Updating Salt Bootstrap
.sp
If you like running the latest and greatest version of salt\-bootstrap, but
you\(aqre sick of tracking down the source directory to update it, a new option
has been added to update it for you.
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt\-cloud \-u
salt\-cloud \-\-update\-bootstrap
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Bear in mind that this updates to the latest (unstable) version, so use with
caution.
.SS Modify AWS Tags
.sp
One of the features of AWS is the ability to tag resources. In fact, under the
hood, the names given to EC2 instances by salt\-cloud are actually just stored
as a tag called Name. The ability to manage tags on AWS instances has now been
added to Salt Cloud.
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt\-cloud \-a get_tags mymachine
salt\-cloud \-a set_tags mymachine tag1=somestuff tag2=\(aqOther stuff\(aq
salt\-cloud \-a del_tags mymachine tag1,tag2,tag3
.ft P
.fi
.SS Rename AWS Instances
.sp
As mentioned above, AWS instances are named via a tag. However, renaming an
instance by renaming its tag will cause the salt keys to mismatch. A rename
function has been added which renames both the instance, and the salt keys.
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt\-cloud \-a rename mymachine newname=yourmachine
.ft P
.fi
.SS AWS Termination Protection
.sp
AWS allows the user to enable and disable termination protection on a specific
instance. An instance with this protection enabled cannot be destroyed.
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt\-cloud \-a enable_term_protect mymachine
salt\-cloud \-a disable_term_protect mymachine
.ft P
.fi
.SS Setting up New Salt Masters
.sp
It has become increasingly common for users to set up multi\-hierarchal
infrastructures using Salt Cloud. This sometimes involves setting up an
instance to be a master in addition to a minion. With that in mind, you can
now law down master configuration on a machine by specifying master options
in the profile or map file.
.sp
.nf
.ft C
make_master: True
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This will cause Salt Cloud to generate master keys for the instance, and tell
salt\-bootstrap to install the salt\-master package, in addition to the
salt\-minion package.
.sp
The default master configuration is usually appropriate for most users, and
will not be changed unless specific master configuration has been added to the
profile or map:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
master:
    user: root
    interface: 0.0.0.0
.ft P
.fi
.SS Keeping /tmp/ Files
.sp
When Salt Cloud deploys an instance, it uploads temporary files to /tmp/ for
salt\-bootstrap to put in place. After the script has run, they are deleted. To
keep these files around (mostly for debugging purposes), the \-\-keep\-tmp option
can be added:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt\-cloud \-p myprofile mymachine \-\-keep\-tmp
.ft P
.fi
.sp
For those wondering why /tmp/ was used instead of /root/, this had to be done
for images which require the use of sudo, and therefore do not allow remote
root logins, even for file transfers (which makes /root/ unavailable).
.SS Deploy Script Arguments
.sp
Custom deploy scripts are unlikely to need custom arguments to be passed to
them, but salt\-bootstrap has been extended quite a bit, and this may be
necessary. script_args can be specified in either the profile or the map
file, to pass arguments to the deploy script:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
aws\-amazon:
    provider: aws
    image: ami\-1624987f
    size: Micro Instance
    ssh_username: ec2\-user
    script: bootstrap\-salt
    script_args: \-c /tmp/
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This has also been tested to work with pipes, if needed:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
script_args: | head
.ft P
.fi
.SS Remove Old SSH Keys
.sp
When an instance is destroyed, its IP address is usually recycled back into
the IP pool. When such an IP is reassigned to you, and the old key is still in
your known_hosts file, the deploy script will fail due to mismatched SSH keys.
To mitigate this, add the following to your main cloud configuration:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
delete_sshkeys: True
.ft P
.fi
.SS Salt Cloud 0.8.6 Release Notes
.sp
Welcome to 0.8.6! This is an exciting release, especially for EC2 users. To see
what new features are available, read on.
.SS Documentation
.sp
The documentation for Salt Cloud can be found on Read the Docs:
\fI\%http://salt-cloud.readthedocs.org\fP
.SS Download
.sp
Salt Cloud can be downloaded and install via pypi:
.sp
\fI\%http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/s/salt-cloud/salt-cloud-0.8.6.tar.gz\fP
.sp
Some packages have been made available for salt\-cloud and more on on their
way. Packages for Arch and FreeBSD are being made available thanks to the
work of Christer Edwards, and packages for RHEL and Fedora are being created
by Clint Savage. The Ubuntu PPA is being managed by Sean Channel. Package
availability will be announced on the salt mailing list.
.SS Updated libcloud
.sp
This version of Salt Cloud now depends upon libcloud version 0.12.1. Be sure to
update your packages accordingly.
.SS Salt Outputter
.sp
Previously, output from Salt Cloud was a mix of log output and print
statements, while the Salt outputter system has grown into a beautiful,
configurable tool. This release of Salt Cloud now takes advantage of the Salt
outputter system, making the output from the salt\-cloud command much more
beautiful, easy to read, and usable from other scripts.
.SS Experimental EC2 Driver
.sp
A new driver has been introduced for Amazon EC2, to potentially replace the
existing AWS driver. This driver contains several optimizations which have been
found to greatly improve instance creation and deployment. They also allow for
extra functionality to be added, which is not currently available in the AWS
driver. However, it should be noted that the EC2 driver is currently considered
to be experiemental. While existing AWS usage should not currently differ, it
should be expected to change between versions until it is declared stable.
.sp
Many of the features of this release are specific to the EC2 driver. Please
check the AWS documentation for configuration and usage of the EC2 driver.
.SS AWS/EC2 Rename on Destroy
.sp
When instances on AWS are destroyed, there will be a lag between the time that
the action is sent, and the time that Amazon cleans up the instance. During this
time, the instance still retails a Name tag, which will cause a collision if the
creation of an instance with the same name is attempted before the cleanup
occurs. In order to avoid such collisions, Salt Cloud can be configured to
rename instances when they are destroyed. The new name will look something like:
.sp
In order to enable this, add AWS.rename_on_destroy line to the main
configuration file:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
AWS.rename_on_destroy: True
.ft P
.fi
.SS New Action: show_instance
.sp
This action is a thin wrapper around \-\-full\-query, which displays details on a
single instance only. In an environment with several machines, this will save a
user from having to sort through all instance data, just to examine a single
instance.
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ salt\-cloud \-a show_instance myinstance
.ft P
.fi
.SS Actions vs Functions
.sp
Salt Cloud 0.8.3 introduced the concept of provider\-specific actions. However,
these actions were designed to operate on specific instances within a provider.
In order to perform calls on a provider, but not on specific instances,
functions have been added. Currently, only EC2 takes advantage of these.
.SS New Function: show_image
.sp
This is a function that describes an AMI on EC2. This will give insight as to
the defaults that will be applied to an instance using a particular AMI.
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ salt\-cloud \-f show_image ec2 image=ami\-fd20ad94
.ft P
.fi
.SS EC2: delvol_on_destroy
.sp
This argument overrides the default DeleteOnTermination setting in the AMI for
the root EBS volume for an instance. Many AMIs contain \(aqfalse\(aq as a default,
resulting in orphaned volumes in the EC2 account, which may unknowingly be
charged to the account. This setting can be added to the profile or map file
for an instance.
.sp
.nf
.ft C
delvol_on_destroy: True
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This can also be set as a global setting in the EC2 cloud configuration:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
EC2.delvol_on_destroy: True
.ft P
.fi
.sp
The setting for this may be changed on an existing instance using one of the
following commands:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt\-cloud \-a delvol_on_destroy myinstance
salt\-cloud \-a keepvol_on_destroy myinstance
.ft P
.fi
.SS EC2 Termination Protection
.sp
AWS allows the user to enable and disable termination protection on a specific
instance. An instance with this protection enabled cannot be destroyed. The EC2
driver adds a show_term_protect action to the regular AWS functionality.
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt\-cloud \-a show_term_protect mymachine
salt\-cloud \-a enable_term_protect mymachine
salt\-cloud \-a disable_term_protect mymachine
.ft P
.fi
.SS EC2 Alternate Endpoint
.sp
Normally, ec2 endpoints are build using the region and the service_url. The
resulting endpoint would follow this pattern:
.sp
This results in an endpoint that looks like:
.sp
There are other projects that support an EC2 compatibility layer, which this
scheme does not account for. This can be overridden by specifying the endpoint
directly in the main cloud configuration file:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
EC2.endpoint: myendpoint.example.com:1138/services/Cloud
.ft P
.fi
.SS EC2 Volume Management
.sp
The EC2 driver has several functions and actions for management of EBS volumes.
.SS Creating Volumes
.sp
A volume may be created, independent of an instance. A zone must be specified.
A size or a snapshot may be specified (in GiB). If neither is given, a default
size of 10 GiB will be used. If a snapshot is given, the size of the snapshot
will be used.
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt\-cloud \-f create_volume ec2 zone=us\-east\-1b
salt\-cloud \-f create_volume ec2 zone=us\-east\-1b size=10
salt\-cloud \-f create_volume ec2 zone=us\-east\-1b snapshot=snap12345678
.ft P
.fi
.SS Attaching Volumes
.sp
Unattached volumes may be attached to an instance. The following values are
required: name or instance_id, volume_id and device.
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt\-cloud \-a attach_volume myinstance volume_id=vol\-12345 device=/dev/sdb1
.ft P
.fi
.SS Show a Volume
.sp
The details about an existing volume may be retreived.
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt\-cloud \-a show_volume myinstance volume_id=vol\-12345
salt\-cloud \-f show_volume ec2 volume_id=vol\-12345
.ft P
.fi
.SS Detaching Volumes
.sp
An existing volume may be detached from an instance.
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt\-cloud \-a detach_volume myinstance volume_id=vol\-12345
.ft P
.fi
.SS Deleting Volumes
.sp
A volume that is not attached to an instance may be deleted.
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt\-cloud \-f delete_volume ec2 volume_id=vol\-12345
.ft P
.fi
.SS Managing Key Pairs on EC2
.sp
The EC2 driver has the ability to manage key pairs.
.SS Creating a Key Pair
.sp
A key pair is required in order to create an instance. When creating a key pair
with this function, the return data will contain a copy of the private key.
This private key is not stored by Amazon, and will not be obtainable past this
point, and should be stored immediately.
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt\-cloud \-f create_keypair ec2 keyname=mykeypair
.ft P
.fi
.SS Show a Key Pair
.sp
This function will show the details related to a key pair, not including the
private key itself (which is not stored by Amazon).
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt\-cloud \-f delete_keypair ec2 keyname=mykeypair
.ft P
.fi
.SS Delete a Key Pair
.sp
This function removes the key pair from Amazon.
.sp
.nf
.ft C
salt\-cloud \-f delete_keypair ec2 keyname=mykeypair
.ft P
.fi
.SH SALT CLOUD 0.6.0 RELEASE NOTES
.sp
The new Salt project, Salt Cloud, is introduced with version 0.6.0. Salt Cloud
has been developed to ease the automation and integration of Salt with public
cloud providers by allowing cloud vms to be cleanly defined, created and
automatically hooked back into a Salt Master.
.sp
While Salt Cloud is primarily made to build cloud vms to tie into a Salt Mater,
it has been created in a generic way, so that it can be used to provision and
hook systems of any type via the familiar Salt modules system.
.sp
This release supports three public cloud providers (all via libcloud),
Amazon EC2, Rackspace Cloud and Linode.
.SS Documentation
.sp
The documentation for Salt Cloud can be found on Read the Docs:
\fI\%http://salt-cloud.readthedocs.org\fP
.SS Download
.sp
Salt Cloud can be downloaded and install via pypi or github:
.sp
\fI\%http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/s/salt-cloud/salt-cloud-0.6.0.tar.gz\fP
.sp
\fI\%https://github.com/downloads/saltstack/salt-cloud/salt-cloud-0.6.0.tar.gz\fP
.sp
Packages are not yet available, Salt Cloud requires three dependencies, the
salt libs, libcloud, and paramiko.
.SS Extensible With Cloud Modules
.sp
The Salt loader system has been employed to make adding support for additional
public cloud systems just as modular and simple as adding support for new
package managers in Salt.
.sp
Adding support for a new cloud provider is extremely simple, just add a cloud
module and everything cleanly links together.
.SS Define VM Profiles
.sp
The way a vms is created is done via profiles. Profiles are used to define what
properties a vm will have, the cloud provider, the size and the image.
.sp
.nf
.ft C
centos_rackspace:
  provider: rackspace
  image: CentOS 6.2
  size: 1024 server
  os: RHEL6
  minion:
    grains:
        role: webserver
    master: salt.example.com
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This profile will be used to create vms on Rackspace cloud with the CentOS 6.2
image and the Rackspace 1024 vm size. Particulars of the minion config can
also be specified.
.sp
Individual vms can be created from profiles:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# salt\-cloud \-p centos_rackspace web1
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This command creates a vms with the name web1 on the Rackspace cloud and
connects the new vm to a Salt Master located at salt.example.com. The new VM
has the Salt id of web1.
.SS Define Maps of Profiles
.sp
When it is desired to have a predefined mapping of many, or a specific group
of vms then a cloud map can be defined:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
centos_rackspace:
  web1
  web2
  web3
  web4
centos_linode:
  redis1
  riak1
  riak2
  riak3
ubuntu_ec2:
  dev1
  dev2
  cassandra1
  cassandra2
  cassandra3
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This map file will create vms named web 1\-4 using the centos_rackspace profile
on rackspace, the redis and riak vms on linode and the dev and Cassandra vms on
ec2. It can be run with salt\-cloud:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# salt\-cloud \-m mapfile
.ft P
.fi
.sp
When creating more than one vm the \-P option can be passed, to make the vms
provision in parallel, greatly speeding up large scale expansions of vms.
.SH SALT CLOUD 0.7.0 RELEASE NOTES
.sp
Salt Cloud marches forward with the 0.7.0 release. As is customary for Salt
Stack projects the 0.7.0 release is intended to be much more robust and
deliver a more complete core feature set. Salt Cloud 0.7.0 is just that.
.sp
With new tools to help look into what is available on cloud providers,
new additions to make cloud management more stateful and the addition of
more supported cloud platforms 0.7.0 has greatly enhanced the capabilities
of the overall Salt platform.
.SS Documentation
.sp
The documentation for Salt Cloud can be found on Read the Docs:

.SS Destroy!
.sp
Salt Cloud can now destroy cloud vms as easily as it can create them. The new
\fB\-\-destroy\fP option can be passed to end the life of a vm:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ salt\-cloud \-d web1
.ft P
.fi
.sp
The map operation can now also destroy vms, the new \fBhard\fP option can be
passed which makes vm maps much more stateful. With the \fBhard\fP option the
vm maps are viewed as the absolute source of information for the state of
cloud resources, and any vm that is not specified in the map file will be
destroyed:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[root@saltmaster]# salt\-cloud \-m /etc/salt/cloud.map \-H
The following virtual machines are set to be created:
  web1
  riak4
The following virtual machines are set to be destroyed:
  app7
  devtest4
